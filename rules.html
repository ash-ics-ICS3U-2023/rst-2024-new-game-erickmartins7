        <h1>How to Play Blackjack</h1>
        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>The objective of Blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.</p>

        <h2>Card Values</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value.</li>
            <li>Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points.</li>
            <li>Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points, depending on which value benefits the hand more.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Both the player and the dealer are dealt two cards. The player's cards are dealt face up, while the dealer has one card face up and one card face down (the hole card).</li>
            <li>The player can choose to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand). The player can continue to hit as many times as they want.</li>
            <li>If the player's hand exceeds 21 points, they "bust" and lose the game.</li>
            <li>Once the player stands, the dealer reveals their hole card and must hit until their hand is 17 or higher.</li>
            <li>If the dealer busts, the player wins.</li>
            <li>If neither busts, the hand closest to 21 wins. If it's a tie, it's called a "push" and the player's bet is returned.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Winning and Payouts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>If the player wins, they receive a payout of 1:1.</li>
            <li>If the player gets a Blackjack (an Ace and a 10-point card) and wins, the payout is typically 3:2.</li>
            <li>If the player loses, they lose their bet.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Basic Strategy Tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Always hit if your hand is 11 or lower.</li>
            <li>Stand if your hand is 17 or higher, unless you have a soft 17 (Ace and 6), in which case you should hit.</li>
            <li>Double down on 10 or 11 if the dealer shows a lower card.</li>
            <li>Split Aces and 8s, but never split 10s or 5s.</li>
        </ul>
